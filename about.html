                    <p>I'm a recent graduate of UC Berkeley, using my skills as a designer and storyteller to make
                        technology
                        and information as accessible as possible to the average person. My experiences in
                        product
                        design, UX design, and web development have helped me to be a well-rounded designer who
                        can also
                        think like a user, engineer, <i>and</i> developer.

                        Other than that, I'm a Filipino-American immigrant raised in SoCal, but am slowly being
                        converted to
                        NorCal's
                        charms and nicer weather. I love to dance (focus on open-style/hip-hop), can scroll my
                        TikTok fyp for hours,
                        am an avid webtoon/manga reader, and seek to make everything I come across as aesthetically
                        pleasing as possible.

                    <h3>Design Journey</h3>
                    <p>I spent the majority of my freshman and sophomore years wanting to study computer science
                        and
                        pursue a
                        career in software engineering or web development. But thanks to the student-run Web
                        Design
                        Decal course and a last minute UX Design internship at PureUX Inc, I was introduced to
                        design and
                        I've been hooked ever since. I've
                        definitely
                        come
                        a long way from my first project (<a href="https://rmattflo.github.io/kp-wireframe/">link</a>),
                        and have had some amazing teachers from all the organizations I've been able to be apart
                        of
                        (YHWH Apparel, BDC Office, Shop Spero, Off Their Plate, PureUX Inc, Abba Modern),
                        TrueLement, SimplePractice. <br />During my software/web development phase, I noticed that many
                        of my
                        collaborators in that space focused solely on functionality while giving no thought to form,
                        aesthetics, or general usability. As I transitioned more into design roles within tech, I made
                        it a goal to work with engineers/developers to put human users <i>first</i>.
                        <br />Design has filled
                        my
                        life
                        with
                        so much color and life, and I have no regrets pivoting into the design field.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Design Philosphy</h3>
                    <p><i>“Accessibility, Empathy, Simplicity, Humanity.”</i> <br /> Essentially, my aim with any of my
                        designs
                        is
                        to
                        build relatable and easy to understand designs that display what is truly essential,
                        omitting
                        the superfluous. In my opinion, if a user cannot tell that a product is “designed”, I’ve
                        done my
                        job well.

                    <p>I'm Robb Matthew Flores, but I go by Matt. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied

                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility and have a passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
                        and playing video games. Feel free to ask me for recomendations for food/boba, my
                        favorite
                        open-style
