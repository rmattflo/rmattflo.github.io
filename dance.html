            <p>Abba Modern's fall 2019 set, performed at Danceworx and AFX showcases. I had the immense pleasure of
              choreographing
              two separate sections for this set, one in collaboration with James Shin, and the other in collaboration
              with Aileen Gui.
              This set allowed me the opportunity to explore both urban and contemporary movement, as well as learn more
              about the
              choreography and teaching processes. While it definitely pushed me to my limits, I was able to grow a lot
              from this set that
              is meant to be pure worship to God. </p>

            <p>A concept video welcoming the new Abba Modern pledge class and showcasing our Fall
              2019 urban audition piece. The highest production shoot I have ever been apart of,
              it was nice to go back to my roots and dance to something urban. Although I usually
              do not act like a "cool" or "smug" character, it was very fun to channel that side of
              myself during this shoot. I'm definitely more comfortable with this style of urban, so
              it was a very fun shoot that helped me return to the original style of dance I began with. </p>

            <p>Abba Modern's set for the spring 2019 semester and my very first live dance set I ever performed.
              This set will always have a special place in my heart because it was the set that made me fall in love
              with urban dance. I was able to choreograph the closer with Sarah Song and Rebekah Tang, and learned
              so much from every single team member. This set's story follows a man strayed away from God listening
              to the testimony of his friend and learning that he can be redeemed by the grace of Christ. </p>

            <p>A video project led by Christy Tak. My first encounter with contemporary dance and
              aiding in the video making process. Although I have no semblance of technique or
              formal training, it was extremely fun and challenging to push my body with a
              different style of altogether. This project portrays the redemptive power of Jesus Christ
              and humanity's reliance on God. It was such an interesting learning process, trying to adapt
              to the outdoors, but I am very pleased with the end result. </p>

          <div class="subdes">
            <p>My first video project with Abba Modern, led by Sarah Song. With this video, I
              felt so powerfully that dance was being used as more than just bodily movement,
              but as a vehicle that portrayed emotion, story, and visionary art. With the style being
              a combination of urban and contemporary dance, it was definitely a push for me to
              learn, though I am very grateful for the growth this provided. It was an incredible
              privilege to be apart of this project.</p>

            <p>My first set with TruElement. Since starting urban dance in college, I aspired to join TruElement, and
              during the spring 2020 semester, I was finally accepted. So many of my inspirations and role models in the
              Berkeley Dance Community are apart of this team, so it was truly a blessing and privilege to be apart of
              this team. I'm very proud of the fact that, although the circumstances of the COVID-19 coronavirus cut the
              time this team had short, we were able to put this together in 4 weeks.

            <p>My first live set with The [M]ovement; an urban video set directed by Jennifer Xie
              and Beini Liu. Filled with nostaglic songs from the early 2010s, this set
              reminisiced on the musical hits of our middle school era. Through this team, I was able to
              make many of my now closest friends and was able to fall in love with dance again. Overall, the upbeat,
              groovey, and energetic choreography fit my style well. It was refreshing just to dance to pop music
              and perform a "feel-good" set! </p>

            <p>My first experience with The [M]ovement; an urban video project led by Alyssa Yee.
              This video portrays the need to break out of the melancholy of routine everyday life.
              The experience of participating in this video project was incredible , since I could see so clearly
              how Alyssa was trying to portray her story through the choreography. It was truly an honor to be apart of
              such a relatable and meaningful piece.</p>

            <p>My first time dancing with an AFX training team, specifically under Grace Lee, Alicia Chow, and Soo Rim
              Choi.
              With this team being a "training" team, I was able to go back to fundamentals and train the basics of
              dance that
              I may have neglected. The opportunity to dance on Reflect allowed me to also create lifelong friendships,
              as I was able
              to expand my network within the Berkeley Dance Community. This set portrays the different ways one might
              look at themselves
              in the mirror, but ends with embracing oneself for who they are. A pure joy to be apart of.
