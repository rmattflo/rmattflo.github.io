              <p>Abba Modern's fall 2020 set, filmed virtually. This was my first semester acting as executive director,
                videographer, editor, and choreographer for Abba Modern. Due to COVID-19, the team pivoted towards a
                virtual format and a video project for our end-of-semester deliverable. The process of creating this
                video was long, but gratifying, from the choreography, to the storyboarding, to the filming, to the
                editing. This video is an ode to this semester's team, who stuck it out even in the midst of a pandemic
                and virtual semester of college. This piece is about being able to stand up, go forward, and continue
                running our races even in times of struggle and hardship, because we know that our God is a good God.

              <p>Abba Modern's spring 2020 set, filmed virtually. This semester was cut short due to the sudden spike of
                COVID-19. As such, this set, meant to be for stage, was reformatted to video. I had the pleasure of
                choreographing the second section with LoriAnn Kim, and got to explore isolations and hard hitting
                movement. As chief editor of this video, there were many sections that were unchoreographed and little
                to no planned transitions, so I used this opportunity to showcase what could have been, using practice
                videos from pre-COVID times. This piece is about the struggle of complacency, confusion, and general
                spiritual warfare, and how in the end, we can proudly declare Jesus wins the victory.</p>

              <p>Abba Modern's fall 2019 set, performed at Danceworx and AFX showcases. I had the immense pleasure of
                choreographing
                two separate sections for this set, one in collaboration with James Shin, and the other in collaboration
                with Aileen Gui.
                This set allowed me the opportunity to explore both open-style and contemporary movement, as well as
                learn
                more
                about the
                choreography and teaching processes. While it definitely pushed me to my limits, I was able to grow a
                lot
                from this set that
                is meant to be pure worship to God. </p>

                it was nice to go back to my roots and dance to something open-style. Although I usually
                do not act like a "cool" or "smug" character, it was very fun to channel that side of
                myself during this shoot. I'm definitely more comfortable with this style of open-style, so
                it was a very fun shoot that helped me return to the original style of dance I began with. </p>

              <p>Abba Modern's set for the spring 2019 semester and my very first live dance set I ever performed.
                This set will always have a special place in my heart because it was the set that made me fall in love
                with open-style dance. I was able to choreograph the closer piece with Sarah Song and Rebekah Tang, and
                learned
                so much from every single team member. This set's story follows a man strayed away from God listening
                to the testimony of his friend and learning that he can be redeemed by the grace of Christ. </p>

              <p>My first video project with Abba Modern, led by Sarah Song. With this video, I
                felt so powerfully that dance was being used as more than just bodily movement,
                but as a vehicle that portrayed emotion, story, and visionary art. With the style being
                a combination of open-style and contemporary dance, it was definitely a push for me to
                learn, though I am very grateful for the growth this provided. It was an incredible

                movement, this video project is meant to be light hearted and convey what the Fall 2020 season has been

                make many of my now closest friends and was able to fall in love with dance again. Overall, the upbeat,

                dance that
                I may have neglected. The opportunity to dance on Reflect allowed me to also create lifelong

                as I was able
                to expand my network within the Berkeley Dance Community. This set portrays the different ways one might
