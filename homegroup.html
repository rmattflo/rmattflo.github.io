      <p><b>Tool:</b> Figma
      </p>
      <p><b>Task:</b> COVID-19 has all members of homegroup stuck at home. Throughout the summer, each member will
        no doubt learn new skills, interact with some type of media, or hone their craft in their respective fields.
        At the end of the summer, create a project that showcases the skill(s) you’ve learned, the lessons you’ve
        learned,
        or the unique experiences you have made. Some project ideas may include a book report, writing a song,
        performing
        a choreography, or making a video, but the options are endless. Have fun with this project and present what
        you
        were able to learn this summer!

    <p><b>Process:</b></p>
    <p>I originally recruited for the Summer 2020 season looking for a front-end software engineering internship and
      had
      that opportunity taken away due to the circumstances of COVID-19. So from April to mid-May, I worked diligently
      in
      the recruiting process to find any opportunity that could come my way so that I wouldn’t waste this summer.
      Eventually, I secured an unexpected position as a UX Design intern at PureUX and was able to learn more about
      proper user interface and experience principles and design, and further develop my wireframing, prototyping, and
      design skills. Because this was a sudden shift in career for me, I learned a lot and found a passion, so I have
      pivoted my career aspirations from software engineering to UI/UX Design.</p>
    <p> I wanted my project to showcase this newfound passion and combine it with the very members of this homegroup I
      have come to care for through the summer. So my final product became a collection of simple icons and images
      that
      are
      unique to each member of homegroup, paying homage to some of their unique traits, hobbies, and likes. Each icon
      and
      all of their components are hand made with the tools in figma, as to challenge myself to create without pulling
      any
      components from other online sources.
    </p>
    <p> While I began by creating each icon as an individual entity, I found myself working in a common theme,
      designing
      each icon with a simplistic and minimalistic theming. As much as possible I tried to make every component and
      shape
      out of simple polygons and shapes. I challenged myself to try and make these icons as recognizable as possible
      with
      the least amount of detail possible. The end result turned into a collection of individual icon snapshots that
      all
      share this minimalistic theming and each take some of the items I associate with each respective homegroup
      member.
      I
      found myself using creative problem solving to make the most out of the simplistic shape and distortion tools to
      create each image, like using ellipses and a rectangle to create sillhouttes of cylinders. From gaming, to penny
      boarding, to a love for baked goods, to a new found addiction for webtoons and netflix, I had a funtime creating
      these icons as gifts for each member of homegroup.
