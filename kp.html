        <p><b>Task:</b> After looking at the current website for KingPin Donut, a local Berkeley donut shop, take note

          its poor design and
          lack of UX principles in its design. Them create a wireframe to make improvements to the
          website that
          applies the UX design principles taught in class. Feel free to deviate from color scheme and theming, but make
          sure to keep the
          focal point
          as the donuts and products of the company, while still showcasing the rich history of the establishment.

      <p><b>Overview</b></p>
      <p>This was my very first project for a web design course I took during the fall 2019 semester. Each student was
        assigned to
        redesign Berkeley local donut shop, KingPin Donut's website, creating a high fidelity wire frame as the end
        product.
        While I first used Adobe XD to create a low fidelity wireframe, I then switched over to HTML and CSS, to create
        an
        almost fully-functional website to present. This high fidelity site works at almost full capacity, only missing
        the
        back-end code for the contact tab. From the webbing together of the different sites, to the page layout, to the
        color
        palatte, I created everything from scratch. While it may be simple, this project introduced me into the world of
        web
        design, and for that I am very grateful.</p>
      <p><b>Ideation</b></p>
      <p>The first thing I did was look at my source material, the original KingPin Donut site. Upon inspecting the
        site,
        I noticed the harshly bright pink, and the text that isn't contrasting that color well, and the lack of cohesive
        design across a single page and as a collection of pages holistically. So before even making my first wireframe,
        I
        knew I needed to improve on a few things. I constructed a color scheme (black, white, gray, and pink) thought of
        different ways of reorganizing the information on the pages to improve their presentation.

        <div class="kp-wftext">
          <p>Utilizing Adobe XD, I created a single file that built all the screens, one on top of the other, using the
            new
            color scheme as a base. I chose to keep the same screen organizations, having home, our story, menu, and
            contact
            us pages, as well as the navigation bar to keep the UI simple and easy to navigate. I also handpicked 2 of
            the
            most appetizing images as my focal points.
            I made sure that the
            2 images I chose displayed many of the products KingPin offered to give a better insight into what products
            were
            sold.
            By picking 2 images, I would be able to refocus the pages on one image instead of sixteen, and it would make
            the
            page
            look cleaner and sleeker. I then went through a reorganized the information on each page, keeping the most
            important information at the center and making that larger. I also reogranized the menu into different
            compartment boxes to more easily find specific products.
          </p>
          <p>As a whole, I tried to keep a minimalistic feel to the site in order to keep the focus on the content and
            the
            images. As supposed to making a super busy and complex site that could confuse and overwhelm the user, this
            simple design would make the UI intuitive and easy to navigate. Having a mainly white screen would allow for
            a more guranteed contrast between text and background, which was an issue in the original site. I then used
            the same pink from the site as the main highlight color to add some variety in color and pay homage to the
            original site. To further add to the more modern and sleek design I decided to implement, I changed the
            text styling from a Serif style to a Sans Serif style in order to lose the dated feel of the original site's
            text.

      <p><b>Translating Wireframe to High-Fidelty Prototype Website</b></p>
      <p> After finishing the wireframe and getting approval from an instructor, I move on to translating the wireframe
        designs onto GitHub Pages using HTML and CSS. Early on, the instructors emphasized no need to work on the
        back-end
        of the site (such as inputting the information from the contact us page). As such, I focused mainly on placement
        of
        elements and efficient organization/structure of code. In order to maintain the stylization, I mainly used
        flexbox
        in order to stack elements into rows and columns.
