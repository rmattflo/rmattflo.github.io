                                    <p>The task is fairly straightforward and the design team was given a basic color
                                        scheme and theme concept to go
                                        off. As a
                                        team, we collectively thought of the essential necessities that an app like this
                                        would require. We decided that
                                        the app
                                        should include features such as chat, timeline/calendar, profiles, to-do lists,
                                        insights, retrospectives and
                                        reminder
                                        notifications, and that other features like outside resources and how-tos can be
                                        added behind a paywall. This
                                        whole ideation process was done through constant communication and preplanned
                                        designation of tasks via slack
                                        and notion. Each week, we used these two tools as a means to stay connected and
                                        continue good cooperation
                                        within the team.

                                    <p>Since our timeline was so short (3 months) to create the app from start to
                                        finish, the design team had to
                                        expedite the
                                        wireframing process as much as possible. Because of this, we designed a
                                        high-fidelity wireframe using figma.
                                        Team
                                        members were split to work on different screens individually but collaborated to
                                        create a cohesive design that
                                        matched
                                        across the board (iconography, buttons, fonts). We went through 6 different
                                        iterations of the wireframing
                                        process,
                                        going
                                        through experimentation, user testing, and manager approval, to create our final
                                        wireframe, prototype 1.6. I
                                        specifically worked on the home, profile, and setting screens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The home screens are the initial screens the user sees upon logging into the app,
                                        so the intention behind the
                                        design was
                                        to give all the urgent information that the user might need to see. The user is
                                        able to see how many tasks they
                                        have and
                                        a summary of their patientâ€™s profile information, alongside a column of
                                        information, announcements, reminders,
                                        or
                                        tasks.
                                        Announcements include any urgent updates on the status of their patient, any
                                        upcoming events/appointments, and
                                        emergencies. Reminders provide notifications for recurring tasks like picking up
                                        prescriptions or routine
                                        visits.
                                        Tasks
                                        provide a short summary of the upcoming tasks the user has been assigned, and is
                                        linked to the to-do list
                                        screen.

                                    <p>The settings screen in itself is extremely simple and displays the main

                                        adjust and customize to their liking. After many iterations of user testing, our
                                        UX research and UX
                                        design teams were able to collaborate and decide on the categories of
                                        General/iOS, Your Account,
                                        Notifications, Permissions, Chat, Upgrade, and Log Out, since they are all
                                        general categories that
                                        users all wanted to be able to adjust. Some examples are changing contact
                                        information or the members
                                        of a user's crew, how notifications would be delivered to a mobile device, and
                                        how the chat UI would
                                        function for each user. Here, moreso than anywhere else in the app, the
                                        iconography was integral to
                                        delivering the right information and so we had 3 iterations of user testing with
                                        different icons from
                                        the ionicon library to get our final outcome.

                                    <p>Alongside the screen designs, I was resposible for creating a thorough
                                        walkthrough of every screen in
                                        the app and how each one linked to the next. The whole design team was also
                                        tasked with creating a
                                        holistic style guide and design system so that both the design and software
                                        engineering teams could
                                        keep screen elements consistent across the board.

                                        onboarding processes and their associated screens. We deided to go with an ombre

                                        distinction between these grouped screens and the rest of the app, showing how
                                        these are meant to help with
                                        the set up and that the user has yet to access the actual content of the app.
