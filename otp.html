                                    <p>As the creative team for OffTheirPlate (OTP), I, alongside Liz, Emily, and Danny,
                                        worked on building a brand
                                        book for the new brand of OTP to fit the post-COVID19 repurposing of the
                                        organization to provide economic
                                        aid to food industry with an emphasis on BIPOC and AAPI communities. First, we
                                        had a discussion about what
                                        the aesthetic and vibe of the new company should be, and we decided to do
                                        something that is uplifting, a bit
                                        child-like, and very happy. As such, we chose a very vbirant primary color
                                        scheme with a more neutral
                                        secondary color scheme, as seen below.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">

                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Liz was able to create a beautifully simple logo concept using overlapping,
                                        playful circles with the “Off
                                        Their Plate” text using the same yellow and red from the colors above to
                                        maintain cohesiveness. She also
                                        included how it could be used alongside images or with our visual assets.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <img src="images/personal/OTP/LOGO.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>The typography itself is also quite playful and uses only sans serif fonts to
                                        give a more modern and playful
                                        feel to the company’s brand. The header font, Thistails Sans, is incredibly
                                        playful and reminiscent of comic
                                        sans while retaining some sense of professionalism, while the rest of the body
                                        text uses more standard fonts
                                        for easy accessibility and readability. We decided to make accent font used for
                                        callout and highlighted text
                                        pseudo-caligraphic to stand out from the rest of the sans-serif text, but we
                                        struggled finding a font that
                                        was still easily legible. In the end, Thistails Regular worked out well because
                                        it struck the balance
                                        between standing out and still being readable.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">

                                    <p>In flushing out the visual aspect of our brand, we built our background design,
                                        using white tesselating hands
                                        on our brand colors to maintain cohesivity while also adding some visual
                                        stimulation. The tesselating hands
                                        themselves are meant to symbolize community and how each of us, when put
                                        together, all come together to make
                                        some beautiful. In addition we created a visualization to our tagline “tackling
                                        the logistics of hunger”
                                        using our main font “Thistails”.

                                    <p>In collaboration with the writing, photography, and partnership investment teams,
                                        I was able to build the
                                        organization’s website via SquareSpace. I heavily relied on the images sent in
                                        by
                                        the photography team and
                                        the brand book the creative team made together as inspirations for the site’s
                                        layout, and focused mainly on
                                        highlighting images and using a small amount of words to highlight what was most
                                        important. All of the
                                        site’s calls to actions were made yellow to stand out and the I decided it was
                                        best
                                        to use the green and
                                        cream the main background colors because they were more cool and neutral, so
                                        that
                                        the black text and yellow
                                        calls to action could pop more. You can view the site <a

                                    <p>I was also tasked with creating the blog/resource secondary site for OTP called
                                        “Second Helping.” I wasn’t
                                        given many guidelines by Neelie, the manager of the creative team, other than
                                        “match the branding of the
                                        main OTP site” and “showcase our articles blog style”, and so I worked off of
                                        the formatting of the site.
                                        The only thing I changed in terms of branding was using the dark navy blue based
                                        off of the branding of
                                        Second Helping, but the navigation was meant to feel similar to the OTP site.
                                        However, I designed this site
                                        keeping in mind that the main demographic is no longer the general public, but
                                        instead chefs and restaurant
                                        owners that are interested in the research and resources OTP freely provides to
                                        aid the restaurant industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> Since the main function was to show our published articles, resources, and
                                        research, I categorized the work
                                        into 2 sections, industry reports and resources. Both of these are presented as
                                        clickable windows that will
                                        lead to previewable pdfs that can be downloaded. I formatted them to be in a
                                        horizontal display gallery,
                                        that can be scrolled through, where each window displays the main information
                                        within each article (i.e.
