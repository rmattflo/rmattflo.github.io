          I collaborated with YHWH Apparel's vice president, Peter Thompson, on this project and created
          a completely revamped website from scratch to suit our company's updated business needs, theme, 
          and image. The design team provided a mid-fidelity wireframe and all the assets, but left quite a bit of
          freedom for Peter and I to design and layout the page. Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, this site is 
          by far the most complex website project I've worked on to date, but I learned a lot about proper coding 
          and structure etiquette, collaboration, web design, and the different site-creating languages used.

          This was my very first project for a web design course I took during the fall 2019 semester. Each student 
          was assigned to redesign Berkeley local donut shop, KingPin Donut's website, creating a high fidelity wire
          frame as the end product. While I first used Adobe XD to create a low fidelity wireframe, I then switched 
          over to HTML and CSS, to create an almost fully-functional website to present. This high fidelity site works 
          at almost full capacity, only missing the back-end code for the contact tab. From the webbing together of the different
          sites, to the page layout, to the color palatte, I created everything from scratch. While it may be simple, this project 
          introduced me into the world of web design, and for that I am very grateful.

          This was the final project of a design ideation and innovation course I took in the spring 2020 semester. In collaboration 
          with my team of 5, we were tasked with finding a prevalent problem and, utilizing the different innovation processes 
          learned throughout the course, create a tangible solution. My team, 4AM, focused on the issue of poor posture and back/neck
          pain in young people caused by technology addiction. 
          
          <br>Our solution was to create a chair-attachable neck and back support apparatus lined with sensors and a notification 
          system that alerts the user when they aren't practicing proper posture habits. In addition to this, we added detachability 
          to the back cushion (that is also lined with sensors) to make some part of the back support portable and usable in any situation.
          With this product, we also created created a low-fidelity wireframe for a companion app that would receive notifcations from the
          apparatus to give another layer of accountability for the user.
         
          <br>We did extensive background research on technology (laptop and phone) usage
          habits from young people, posture, lumbar and neck support, and behavior correct in order to gain a better understanding
          of the problem we were tacking. From there we created problem reports, personas, customer profiles, shareholder maps, 
          abstraction ladders, a creative matrix, and several storyboards (both ecological and interaction). Along the way, we also 
          made several sketches and prototypes (both 3D modeled on CAD and physical). Our final presentation consisted of a 10 minute deck 
          presentation, live Q&A, and a demonstration of our product.
