                                    <p>I was hired as a product design intern focused on enhancing the design system, so
                                        my
                                        projects focused on building components, adding documentation/redlining, and
                                        adding other enhancements. In addition, my manager, Edric, gave me to
                                        opportunity to also work on an exploration project with Sangeeta (PM Intern) and
                                        a user research project. I also was an active participant in weekly design
                                        critiques,
                                        where I gave and received feedback to improve designs. <br />

                                    <p>The design system (June 2021), while organized well into separate files and pages
                                        based on type of information (base, components, icons, etc), had a lack of
                                        documentation, redlining, and overall polish. I was tasked with cleaning up the
                                        design system in its entirety. At the time, the design system, at it’s best, was
                                        a sticker sheet that had components grouped together, but with no way to know
                                        how/when to use variations of components, such as buttons or headers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>After an initial audit of the entire design system, I found 3 main factors that
                                        when improved altogether would enhance the design system greatly: navigation,
                                        documentation, and context.</p>
                                    <p><b>Navigation</b>: After syncing up with other designers on the team and
                                        reflecting on
                                        my own onboarding experience with the design system, I realized that the design
                                        system was difficult and unintuitive to navigate. Although components were
                                        organized well, navigating from page to page and finding specific components was
                                        difficult. To combat this, I did 3 things:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I built a table of contents landing page where designers were able to see an
                                            overview of the exact contents of each page. This table of contents
                                            contained the page title, description, and clickable link for easy
                                            navigation. I added two ways to view this table of contents: 1 on the design
                                            system file in Figma, and one in our design team’s Notion page, both of
                                            which you can see here. <p></p>
                                        </li>
                                        <div class="row">
                                            <img src="images/personal/sp/intern/contents.png" class="image"
                                                width="100%">
                                        </div>
                                        <p></p>
                                        <li>I formatted each page the same way to add some logical reasoning as to how
                                            to navigate each page. Before, each page was organized individually and
                                            uniquely, so I reorganized files to be viewed horizontally. This way, each
                                            page reads like a book.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>One huge complaint I heard from designers across the board was a lack of
                                            searchability and visibility for components, specifically icons. So, I went
                                            about researching a new naming convention with alternate name tags so that
                                            figma’s built-in component search function would work more optimally for
                                            designers.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><b>Documentation</b>: In general there was a lack of documentation and commenting
                                        in the
                                        design system, making it difficult to know what exactly a designer is looking
                                        at. To fix this, I added a guidelines caption to every frame that summarizes the
                                        exact contents.</p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <div class="row">

                                    <p><b>Context</b>: To add to documentation, I also added screenshots and examples
                                        pulled
                                        from SimplePractice products to show how the components should be used when
                                        designing and how they appear in reality when launched.

                                        <h2>Project 2: Header Call to Action Button Logic System
                                        </h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>Another issue identified in the design system was that there was no rhyme or
                                        reason when placing Call to Action (CTA) buttons in the header of pages.
                                        Throughout the product, CTA buttons are present in the header to help identify
                                        the most important actions, but the lack of systematic logic and cohesivity led
                                        to confusion. I was tasked with creating a logic system for any header CTA
                                        button grouping.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>To begin, I performed a full platform audit to identify all pages with header CTA
                                        buttons and grouped them into 5 groups: 1 CTA, 2 CTAs, 3 CTAs, 3+ CTAs, and full
                                        screen modal toolbar CTAs. By identifying each page with header CTA buttons and
                                        grouping them based on the number of buttons, I was able to identify some
                                        patterns and build out a basic logic system.</p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <img src="images/personal/sp/intern/audit.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>At this point, I was finding more and more edge cases, and pivoted from adjusting
                                        the logic to reorganizing some of the button groupings to match the logic.
                                        Additionally, I began facilitating workshops with other designers to make
                                        decisions on the copy text of buttons, decide what would be considered universal
                                        actions that could be turned into icons, and create the final look for the drop
                                        down button.</p>
                                    <p>Here’s the deliverable I presented to designers for critique:</p>

                                        </h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>In the spirit of taking ownership of my internship experience, I asked my manager
                                        for a project that involved a lot more research and customer interaction. A few
                                        weeks later, I was added to a group of designers who were focusing on enhancing
                                        the navigation workflow of the web product, focusing on improving client
                                        searchability and visibility. After an initial screening through the facebook
                                        community group and the open feedback form from UserVoice, we identified 2 areas
                                        of improvement: the home screen Search bar and the Recently Viewed tab on the
                                        left hand toolbar.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>After a deliberation meeting with the rest of the navigation team, I was tasked
                                        with creating a 2-part research <a
                                            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sP--MwbeVxUOQc6-vAzaCI3vEbUVJFK-fUFDZCegqGA/edit?usp=sharing">test
                                            plan</a> to identify tangible enhancement solutions SimplePractice could
                                        implement to improve client searchability. In the test plan, I identify our
                                        guiding questions and goals, and spell out explicitly what methods are being
                                        used.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For the first part of the research test plan, I created a survey using Maze to
                                        gather information about the search bar. Since we already had some background
                                        information on the Search bar, we were looking for quantifiable information to
                                        validate our decision making. In particular, we were looking to understand the
                                        customers’ level of satisfaction with the Search bar’s functionality, frequency
                                        of use, and if there were any other search types or domains that they would like
                                        to be searchable. While we did get this information in spades, we also received
                                        surprising pain points about the client search workflow that we immediately sent
                                        to engineering for review.</p>
                                    <p>For the second part of the research test plan, I conducted user interviews with
                                        customers to gain deeper qualitative and quantitative understanding on the
                                        general client search workflow and how useful a tool the Recently Viewed tab is.
                                        Because our questions were more specific and open-ended, asking about individual
                                        workflows and preferences, we went with the interview route to accommodate
                                        different work styles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, my internship ended before the navigation team could fully
                                        synthesize our findings, but the research I did conduct validated much of our
                                        design thinking.</p>

                                        </h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>I had the opportunity to work with a PM intern, Sangeeta, on an exploration
                                        project to see how SimplePractice could expand our product to meet the needs of
                                        prescribing clinicians. After an initial meeting where Sangeeta shared her
                                        research findings, we began a series of daily workshop meetings to discuss
                                        specific functionalities that could be implemented. I was tasked with creating
                                        mockup prototypes to go with her research presentation to show SimplePractice
                                        roadmap managers that this project was worth exploring deeper.</p>
                                    <p>We decided on expanding the client page’s functionality by adding a new tab
                                        called “Health Summary” where prescribing clinicians could view, add, delete,
                                        and edit client medication, allergy, and vitals information. The process of
                                        creating these mockups was an interesting exercise because I had to find a
                                        balance in adhering to the design system and branding of SimplePractice while
                                        innovating and creating a new interface that would benefit prescribing
                                        clinicians specifically.</p>
                                    <p>For the roadmap managers and engineers, I created prototype flows for:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Navigating to the Client Health Summary Page

                                            Allergy, and Vitals Information
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The workflow for adding information to Medication, Allergies or Vitals
                                        </li>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>The workflow for deleting information to Medication, Allergies or Vitals
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Collaborating with Sangeeta was an extremely rewarding experience because I
                                        learned so much about working alongside a product manager and writing user
                                        stories to share with engineers.
