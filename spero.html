            <p><b>Task:</b> Alongside the full rebranding of ShopSpero. (Fall 2020), create a fully redesigned website
                for the company. It should fit the theming and rebranding (minimalistic, mainly cream and neutral
                browns). Elements should include an overview of the company, links to all social media, a way to display
                all products and designs, a page for our team members, and a shop page.

        <p><b>Design and Wirefame</b></p>
        <p>Originally being the head of the web development team, I first worked on building a Notion system that would
            aid in project management and organization. In terms of work flow, I organized it into a 2 week-sprint
            system, and scheduled weekly meetings with the web team, as well as one for me and the design team lead.
            From there, I coordinated with the design lead to finalized the branding guide so that all assets, such as
            marketing, social media, and website, could all be cohesive. The branding guide can be found
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfChsk8TH9lxeLbdvLg_EI-ZM9yUt0ZR/view?usp=sharing">
                here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>As the web team, consisting of James Shin, Carly Feng, Christie Lum, and me, began work on the website, I,
            acting as the UX designer, created the basic wireframe on Figma, including the home, contact, about, and
            staff pages. I worried mainly about user flow and brand cohesivity. The most important things were to keep
            the color scheme and general feel the same, so we could move elements around slightly to make it easier on
            us as we worked on the code structure. While our main color was a light brown/cream, we were given a
            collection of possible accent colors, as seen in this wireframe.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I worked on creating a mobile wireframe to match the visual aesthetic of this design
            iteration, and so I focused on minimalizing the text, converting the design to a more mobile friendly layout
            to accommodate touchscreen. As such, everything is much more vertically oriented, and I also designed a
            collapsible navigation bar to make the mobile site easier to use.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/spero/mobile1.png" class="yp-color">
        <p>
            After gathering feedback from James and the design team, I began work on the second iteration of the
            wireframe, focusing more on the layout, typography, images, and overall atmosphere. After gathering feedback
            from the Shop Spero team, they felt that the website should be minimalistic and plain, so that our products
            and pictures would stand out more. With that as my inspiration, the second wireframe refined the color
            palette to be the cream and olive green, kept the layout very plain, and relied on our images and text as
            the main accent/highlight. In addition, I began work on the original designs page, where I designed a drop
            down system to showcase each of Shop Spero’s original design products. With this iteration of the wireframe,
            I wanted to focus on the minimalism and letting the content itself drive the user’s eye, allowing for easy
            and intuitive navigation/user flow.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/spero/desktop2.png" class="yp-color">
        <p>
            At this point, the team felt that it was time to start incorporating user interviews, survey, and feedback
            into our design, and we found that the layout, while easy to use, felt plain and lazy to some. In addition,
            we found that because of the site’s poor reception from user testing, they were less willing to purchase our
            products. Because of this, we began a third, and final iteration of the site’s design, which focused on
            maintaining the brand’s chiche identity, while adding some more flavor and visual stimulation to improve
            user reception. To do this, I was inspired by our grassroots, from-the-ground-up company founding, and
            decided to play with the paint stroke motif, to symbolize how even the simplest first steps can make
            impactful contributions. The design lead and I were able to design a background and footer with this paint
            stroke motif that doesn’t distract from the main content while adding more visual stimualtion to the page to
            make it more exciting. The home page itself pulls direct inspiration from the brand guide, and the design
            page pulls inspiration from instagram to better display the products we sell.The site layout itself reamins
            simplistic, but more interactive to engage better with the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alongside this final iteration of the site design, I also wireframed the mobile adaptation of the site to be
            responsive as well. It adopts the same paintstroke background and footer from the desktop site, but the
            content and layout is adjusted to better suit touch screen devices (swipe functionality). This mobile design
            relies more heavily on pop up banners to showcase more information so that the landing screens stay clean,
            concise, and easy to navigate.

        <p><b>Desktop Web Development</b></p>
        <p>Being one of four members in the Web Development Team, I collaborated with the rest of the team, in the front
            end web development process. Using GitHub in order to work remotely while collaborating, we utilized HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, relying heavily on the React library to build the site.
        </p>
        <p>We worked first on shared components that would be shared on every screen, such as the navigation bar, logo,
            and footer, as well as more complex components that we decided to put in their own file, such as our design
            carousel. After, we began work on each of the individual pages, where I was responsible for the about page.
            Since my work was more simple, I began helping Christie with implementing the designs page and James with
            researching the Stride API we wanted to use for the shop page. The shop page itself is still in development
            and we are using our etsy as a substitute shop page. In addition, the mobile site is still under development
            as well, but you view the current site here at<a href="https://shopspero.org">shopspero.org</a>
