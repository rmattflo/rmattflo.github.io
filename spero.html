                                        Originally being the head of the web development team, I first worked on
                                        building a
                                        Notion
                                        system that would
                                        aid in project management and organization. In terms of work flow, I organized
                                        it
                                        into a 2
                                        week-sprint
                                        system, and scheduled weekly meetings with the web team, as well as one for me
                                        and
                                        the
                                        design team lead.
                                        From there, I coordinated with the design lead to finalized the branding guide
                                        so
                                        that all
                                        assets, such as
                                        marketing, social media, and website, could all be cohesive. The branding guide
                                        can
                                        be found
                                        <a

                                            here.</a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>As the web team, consisting of James Shin, Carly Feng, Christie Lum, and me,
                                        began work
                                        on the website, I,
                                        acting as the UX designer, created the basic wireframe on Figma, including the
                                        home,
                                        contact, about, and
                                        staff pages. I worried mainly about user flow and brand cohesivity. The most
                                        important
                                        things were to keep
                                        the color scheme and general feel the same, so we could move elements around
                                        slightly to
                                        make it easier on
                                        us as we worked on the code structure. While our main color was a light
                                        brown/cream, we
                                        were given a
                                        collection of possible accent colors, as seen in this wireframe.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <img src="images/personal/spero/desktop1.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the same time, I worked on creating a mobile wireframe to match the visual
                                        aesthetic
                                        of this design
                                        iteration, and so I focused on minimalizing the text, converting the design to a
                                        more
                                        mobile friendly layout
                                        to accommodate touchscreen. As such, everything is much more vertically
                                        oriented, and I
                                        also designed a
                                        collapsible navigation bar to make the mobile site easier to use.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <img src="images/personal/spero/mobile1.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>
                                        After gathering feedback from James and the design team, I began work on the
                                        second
                                        iteration of the
                                        wireframe, focusing more on the layout, typography, images, and overall
                                        atmosphere.
                                        After gathering feedback
                                        from the Shop Spero team, they felt that the website should be minimalistic and
                                        plain,
                                        so that our products
                                        and pictures would stand out more. With that as my inspiration, the second
                                        wireframe
                                        refined the color
                                        palette to be the cream and olive green, kept the layout very plain, and relied
                                        on our
                                        images and text as
                                        the main accent/highlight. In addition, I began work on the original designs
                                        page, where
                                        I designed a drop
                                        down system to showcase each of Shop Spero’s original design products. With this
                                        iteration of the wireframe,
                                        I wanted to focus on the minimalism and letting the content itself drive the
                                        user’s eye,
                                        allowing for easy
                                        and intuitive navigation/user flow.
                                    </p>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <img src="images/personal/spero/desktop2.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>
                                        At this point, the team felt that it was time to start incorporating user
                                        interviews,
                                        survey, and feedback
                                        into our design, and we found that the layout, while easy to use, felt plain and
                                        lazy to
                                        some. In addition,
                                        we found that because of the site’s poor reception from user testing, they were
                                        less
                                        willing to purchase our
                                        products. Because of this, we began a third, and final iteration of the site’s
                                        design,
                                        which focused on
                                        maintaining the brand’s chiche identity, while adding some more flavor and
                                        visual
                                        stimulation to improve
                                        user reception. To do this, I was inspired by our grassroots, from-the-ground-up
                                        company
                                        founding, and
                                        decided to play with the paint stroke motif, to symbolize how even the simplest
                                        first
                                        steps can make
                                        impactful contributions. The design lead and I were able to design a background
                                        and
                                        footer with this paint
                                        stroke motif that doesn’t distract from the main content while adding more
                                        visual
                                        stimualtion to the page to
                                        make it more exciting. The home page itself pulls direct inspiration from the
                                        brand
                                        guide, and the design
                                        page pulls inspiration from instagram to better display the products we sell.The
                                        site
                                        layout itself reamins
                                        simplistic, but more interactive to engage better with the user.

                                        Alongside this final iteration of the site design, I also wireframed the mobile
                                        adaptation of the site to be
                                        responsive as well. It adopts the same paintstroke background and footer from
                                        the
                                        desktop site, but the
                                        content and layout is adjusted to better suit touch screen devices (swipe
                                        functionality). This mobile design
                                        relies more heavily on pop up banners to showcase more information so that the
                                        landing
                                        screens stay clean,
                                        concise, and easy to navigate.

                                    <p>Being one of four members in the Web Development Team, I collaborated with the
                                        rest
                                        of

                                        end web development process. Using GitHub in order to work remotely while
                                        collaborating,
                                        we utilized HTML,
                                        CSS, and JavaScript, relying heavily on the React library to build the site.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We worked first on shared components that would be shared on every screen, such
                                        as
                                        the
                                        navigation bar, logo,
                                        and footer, as well as more complex components that we decided to put in their
                                        own
                                        file,
                                        such as our design
                                        carousel. After, we began work on each of the individual pages, where I was
                                        responsible
                                        for the about page.
                                        Since my work was more simple, I began helping Christie with implementing the
                                        designs
                                        page and James with
                                        researching the Stride API we wanted to use for the shop page. The shop page
                                        itself
                                        is
                                        still in development
                                        and we are using our etsy as a substitute shop page. In addition, the mobile
                                        site is
                                        still under development
                                        as well, but you view the current site here at <a
