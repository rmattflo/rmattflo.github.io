                                </header>
                                <p>As the creative team for OffTheirPlate (OTP), I, alongside Liz, Emily, and Danny,
                                    worked on building a brand
                                    book for the new brand of OTP to fit the post-COVID19 repurposing of the
                                    organization to provide economic
                                    aid to food industry with an emphasis on BIPOC and AAPI communities. First, we
                                    had a discussion about what
                                    the aesthetic and vibe of the new company should be, and we decided to do
                                    something that is uplifting, a bit
                                    child-like, and very happy. As such, we chose a very vbirant primary color
                                    scheme with a more neutral
                                    secondary color scheme, as seen below.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/OTP/COLORS.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Liz was able to create a beautifully simple logo concept using overlapping,
                                    playful circles with the “Off
                                    Their Plate” text using the same yellow and red from the colors above to
                                    maintain cohesiveness. She also
                                    included how it could be used alongside images or with our visual assets.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/OTP/LOGO.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>The typography itself is also quite playful and uses only sans serif fonts to
                                    give a more modern and playful
                                    feel to the company’s brand. The header font, Thistails Sans, is incredibly
                                    playful and reminiscent of comic
                                    sans while retaining some sense of professionalism, while the rest of the body
                                    text uses more standard fonts
                                    for easy accessibility and readability. We decided to make accent font used for
                                    callout and highlighted text
                                    pseudo-caligraphic to stand out from the rest of the sans-serif text, but we
                                    struggled finding a font that
                                    was still easily legible. In the end, Thistails Regular worked out well because
                                    it struck the balance
                                    between standing out and still being readable.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/OTP/TYPOGRAPHY.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>In flushing out the visual aspect of our brand, we built our background design,
                                    using white tesselating hands
                                    on our brand colors to maintain cohesivity while also adding some visual
                                    stimulation. The tesselating hands
                                    themselves are meant to symbolize community and how each of us, when put
                                    together, all come together to make
                                    some beautiful. In addition we created a visualization to our tagline “tackling
                                    the logistics of hunger”
                                    using our main font “Thistails”.
                                </p>

                                <p>Our amazing illustrator, Danny was able to use the colors and conversation from
                                    our meeting to create this
                                    playful and cute illustrations showing the blending of transportation and food,
                                    playing on how our food
                                    industry and economy is essential.

                                <p>In collaboration with the writing, photography, and partnership investment teams,
                                    I was able to build the
                                    organization’s website via SquareSpace. I heavily relied on the images sent in
                                    by
                                    the photography team and
                                    the brand book the creative team made together as inspirations for the site’s
                                    layout, and focused mainly on
                                    highlighting images and using a small amount of words to highlight what was most
                                    important. All of the
                                    site’s calls to actions were made yellow to stand out and the I decided it was
                                    best
                                    to use the green and
                                    cream the main background colors because they were more cool and neutral, so
                                    that
                                    the black text and yellow
                                    calls to action could pop more. You can view the site <a

                                </header>
                                <p>I was also tasked with creating the blog/resource secondary site for OTP called
                                    “Second Helping.” I wasn’t
                                    given many guidelines by Neelie, the manager of the creative team, other than
                                    “match the branding of the
                                    main OTP site” and “showcase our articles blog style”, and so I worked off of
                                    the formatting of the site.
                                    The only thing I changed in terms of branding was using the dark navy blue based
                                    off of the branding of
                                    Second Helping, but the navigation was meant to feel similar to the OTP site.
                                    However, I designed this site
                                    keeping in mind that the main demographic is no longer the general public, but
                                    instead chefs and restaurant
                                    owners that are interested in the research and resources OTP freely provides to
                                    aid the restaurant industry.
                                </p>
                                <p> Since the main function was to show our published articles, resources, and
                                    research, I categorized the work
                                    into 2 sections, industry reports and resources. Both of these are presented as
                                    clickable windows that will
                                    lead to previewable pdfs that can be downloaded. I formatted them to be in a
                                    horizontal display gallery,
                                    that can be scrolled through, where each window displays the main information
                                    within each article (i.e.
                                    “Disparities Amongst BIPOC-Owned Restaurants in America”).

                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility to tech and have a
                        passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
                        and playing video games. Feel free to ask me for recomendations for food/boba, my
                        favorite
                        open-style
                        choreographers
                        and dance teams, my opinions on the direction Pokemon is going towards, or any of my
                        past
                        projects.</p>
