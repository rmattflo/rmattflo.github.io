                                <p>As a small design agency, we were commisioned to design and prototype a mobile app
                                    that would ask as a nurse aid/task management tool for family members of hospital
                                    patients. As apart of the process, we researched what were problems in this area of
                                    work, and we noticed that family members in general struggled to keep up with all
                                    the paperwork and tasks that come with taking care of patients. We focused our work
                                    on alleviating this problem and finding solutions that would aid these family
                                    members. </p>
                                </p>
                                <p>The task is fairly straightforward and the design team was given a basic color
                                    scheme and theme concept to go
                                    off. As a
                                    team, we collectively thought of the essential necessities that an app like this
                                    would require. We decided that
                                    the app
                                    should include features such as chat, timeline/calendar, profiles, to-do lists,
                                    insights, retrospectives and
                                    reminder
                                    notifications, and that other features like outside resources and how-tos can be
                                    added behind a paywall. This
                                    whole ideation process was done through constant communication and preplanned
                                    designation of tasks via slack
                                    and notion. Each week, we used these two tools as a means to stay connected and
                                    continue good cooperation
                                    within the team.

                                </header>
                                <p>Since our timeline was so short (3 months) to create the app from start to
                                    finish, the design team had to
                                    expedite the
                                    wireframing process as much as possible. Because of this, we designed a
                                    high-fidelity wireframe using figma.
                                    Team
                                    members were split to work on different screens individually but collaborated to
                                    create a cohesive design that
                                    matched
                                    across the board (iconography, buttons, fonts). We went through 6 different
                                    iterations of the wireframing
                                    process,
                                    going
                                    through experimentation, user testing, and manager approval, to create our final
                                    wireframe, prototype 1.6. I
                                    specifically worked on the home, profile, and setting screens.
                                </p>
                                <p>The home screens are the initial screens the user sees upon logging into the app,
                                    so the intention behind the
                                    design was
                                    to give all the urgent information that the user might need to see. The user is
                                    able to see how many tasks they
                                    have and
                                    a summary of their patientâ€™s profile information, alongside a column of
                                    information, announcements, reminders,
                                    or
                                    tasks.
                                    Announcements include any urgent updates on the status of their patient, any
                                    upcoming events/appointments, and
                                    emergencies. Reminders provide notifications for recurring tasks like picking up
                                    prescriptions or routine
                                    visits.
                                    Tasks
                                    provide a short summary of the upcoming tasks the user has been assigned, and is
                                    linked to the to-do list
                                    screen.

                                <p>The settings screen in itself is extremely simple and displays the main
                                    categories that a user can
                                    adjust and customize to their liking. After many iterations of user testing, our
                                    UX research and UX
                                    design teams were able to collaborate and decide on the categories of
                                    General/iOS, Your Account,
                                    Notifications, Permissions, Chat, Upgrade, and Log Out, since they are all
                                    general categories that
                                    users all wanted to be able to adjust. Some examples are changing contact
                                    information or the members
                                    of a user's crew, how notifications would be delivered to a mobile device, and
                                    how the chat UI would
                                    function for each user. Here, moreso than anywhere else in the app, the
                                    iconography was integral to
                                    delivering the right information and so we had 3 iterations of user testing with
                                    different icons from
                                    the ionicon library to get our final outcome.

                                <p>Alongside the screen designs, I was resposible for creating a thorough

                                    the app and how each one linked to the next. The whole design team was also
                                    tasked with creating a
                                    holistic style guide and design system so that both the design and software
                                    engineering teams could
                                    keep screen elements consistent across the board.

                                <p>After our wireframes were completed and approved by our project manager, we moved
                                    forward and continued using
                                    Figma,
                                    utilizing the prototype feature and animations to link screens via buttons and
                                    add animations to simulate the
                                    app

                                    accurately as possible. During the prototyping process, we also were able to
                                    start designing the sign in and
                                    onboarding processes and their associated screens. We deided to go with an ombre
                                    effect on both to show a
                                    distinction between these grouped screens and the rest of the app, showing how
                                    these are meant to help with
                                    the set up and that the user has yet to access the actual content of the app.

                                    BuilderX, we began to also link the screens to match the prototyping and made

                    <p>I'm Robb Matthew Flores, but I go by Matt. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied
                        Cognitive Science
                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility to tech and have a
                        passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
                        and playing video games. Feel free to ask me for recomendations for food/boba, my
                        favorite
                        open-style
                        choreographers
                        and dance teams, my opinions on the direction Pokemon is going towards, or any of my
                        past
                        projects.</p>
