                                    Originally being the head of the web development team, I first worked on
                                    building a
                                    Notion
                                    system that would
                                    aid in project management and organization. In terms of work flow, I organized
                                    it
                                    into a 2
                                    week-sprint
                                    system, and scheduled weekly meetings with the web team, as well as one for me
                                    and
                                    the
                                    design team lead.
                                    From there, I coordinated with the design lead to finalized the branding guide
                                    so
                                    that all
                                    assets, such as
                                    marketing, social media, and website, could all be cohesive. The branding guide
                                    can
                                    be found
                                    <a
                                        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfChsk8TH9lxeLbdvLg_EI-ZM9yUt0ZR/view?usp=sharing">

                                </p>
                                <p>As the web team, consisting of James Shin, Carly Feng, Christie Lum, and me,
                                    began work
                                    on the website, I,
                                    acting as the UX designer, created the basic wireframe on Figma, including the
                                    home,
                                    contact, about, and
                                    staff pages. I worried mainly about user flow and brand cohesivity. The most
                                    important
                                    things were to keep
                                    the color scheme and general feel the same, so we could move elements around
                                    slightly to
                                    make it easier on
                                    us as we worked on the code structure. While our main color was a light
                                    brown/cream, we
                                    were given a
                                    collection of possible accent colors, as seen in this wireframe.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/spero/desktop1.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>
                                    At the same time, I worked on creating a mobile wireframe to match the visual
                                    aesthetic
                                    of this design
                                    iteration, and so I focused on minimalizing the text, converting the design to a
                                    more
                                    mobile friendly layout
                                    to accommodate touchscreen. As such, everything is much more vertically
                                    oriented, and I
                                    also designed a
                                    collapsible navigation bar to make the mobile site easier to use.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/spero/mobile1.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>
                                    After gathering feedback from James and the design team, I began work on the
                                    second
                                    iteration of the
                                    wireframe, focusing more on the layout, typography, images, and overall
                                    atmosphere.
                                    After gathering feedback
                                    from the Shop Spero team, they felt that the website should be minimalistic and
                                    plain,
                                    so that our products
                                    and pictures would stand out more. With that as my inspiration, the second
                                    wireframe
                                    refined the color
                                    palette to be the cream and olive green, kept the layout very plain, and relied
                                    on our
                                    images and text as
                                    the main accent/highlight. In addition, I began work on the original designs
                                    page, where
                                    I designed a drop
                                    down system to showcase each of Shop Spero’s original design products. With this
                                    iteration of the wireframe,
                                    I wanted to focus on the minimalism and letting the content itself drive the
                                    user’s eye,
                                    allowing for easy
                                    and intuitive navigation/user flow.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/spero/desktop2.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>
                                    At this point, the team felt that it was time to start incorporating user
                                    interviews,
                                    survey, and feedback
                                    into our design, and we found that the layout, while easy to use, felt plain and
                                    lazy to
                                    some. In addition,
                                    we found that because of the site’s poor reception from user testing, they were
                                    less
                                    willing to purchase our
                                    products. Because of this, we began a third, and final iteration of the site’s
                                    design,
                                    which focused on
                                    maintaining the brand’s chiche identity, while adding some more flavor and
                                    visual
                                    stimulation to improve
                                    user reception. To do this, I was inspired by our grassroots, from-the-ground-up
                                    company
                                    founding, and
                                    decided to play with the paint stroke motif, to symbolize how even the simplest
                                    first
                                    steps can make
                                    impactful contributions. The design lead and I were able to design a background
                                    and
                                    footer with this paint
                                    stroke motif that doesn’t distract from the main content while adding more
                                    visual
                                    stimualtion to the page to
                                    make it more exciting. The home page itself pulls direct inspiration from the
                                    brand
                                    guide, and the design
                                    page pulls inspiration from instagram to better display the products we sell.The
                                    site
                                    layout itself reamins
                                    simplistic, but more interactive to engage better with the user.
                                </p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <img src="images/personal/spero/desktop3.png" class="image" width="100%">
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>
                                    Alongside this final iteration of the site design, I also wireframed the mobile
                                    adaptation of the site to be
                                    responsive as well. It adopts the same paintstroke background and footer from
                                    the
                                    desktop site, but the
                                    content and layout is adjusted to better suit touch screen devices (swipe
                                    functionality). This mobile design
                                    relies more heavily on pop up banners to showcase more information so that the
                                    landing
                                    screens stay clean,
                                    concise, and easy to navigate.

                                <p>Being one of four members in the Web Development Team, I collaborated with the
                                    rest
                                    of
                                    the team, in the front
                                    end web development process. Using GitHub in order to work remotely while
                                    collaborating,
                                    we utilized HTML,
                                    CSS, and JavaScript, relying heavily on the React library to build the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>We worked first on shared components that would be shared on every screen, such
                                    as
                                    the
                                    navigation bar, logo,
                                    and footer, as well as more complex components that we decided to put in their
                                    own
                                    file,
                                    such as our design
                                    carousel. After, we began work on each of the individual pages, where I was
                                    responsible
                                    for the about page.
                                    Since my work was more simple, I began helping Christie with implementing the
                                    designs
                                    page and James with
                                    researching the Stride API we wanted to use for the shop page. The shop page
                                    itself
                                    is
                                    still in development
                                    and we are using our etsy as a substitute shop page. In addition, the mobile
                                    site is
                                    still under development
                                    as well, but you view the current site here at <a

                    <p>I'm Robb Matthew Flores, but I go by Matt. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied
                        Cognitive Science
                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility to tech and have a
                        passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
                        and playing video games. Feel free to ask me for recomendations for food/boba, my
                        favorite
                        open-style
                        choreographers
                        and dance teams, my opinions on the direction Pokemon is going towards, or any of my
                        past
                        projects.</p>
