                                <p>Originally being apart of the Web Development team, Peter and I were handed a
                                    completed desktop wireframe from
                                    Emily and were able to work directly from it. The most important things were to
                                    keep the color scheme and
                                    general
                                    feel the same, so we could move elements around slightly to make it easier on us
                                    as we worked on the code
                                    structure. While our main color was neutral browns, we were given a collection
                                    of possible accent colors, seen
                                    below.

                                <p>When the time came to begin work on the responsive design for both mobile and
                                    tablet platforms, I was apart of
                                    a 4-person summer team. This meant I worked on both web development and design,
                                    so I was able to work in
                                    collaboration
                                    with Emily to create the wireframes for the mobile and tablet screens using both
                                    Adobe XD and Figma. The tablet
                                    screens
                                    for the most part were the same as the desktop screen but had a few adjustments
                                    to fit the sizing and touch
                                    screen.
                                    However, the mobile screens went through a more drastic change to fit the screen
                                    size adjustment. We had to
                                    simplify
                                    elements like our logo and navigation bar, team page, and designs page, among
                                    others, in order to better display
                                    all
                                    our information effectively on this platform.

                                </header>
                                <p>Being one of two members in the Web Development Team, I collaborated with my
                                    superior and mentor, Peter, to
                                    learn more about the web development process. I began shadowing and observing
                                    him as he worked on the home page,
                                    and then began working on my own respective pages once I gained confidence. We
                                    began by working on the same
                                    laptop,
                                    but as I gained more independence throughout the project, we moved to separate
                                    computers and used GitHub as our
                                    main method of collaboration. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, relying
                                    heavily on the React library.
                                </p>
                                <p>We worked first on shared components that would be shared on every screen, such
                                    as the navigation bar, logo,
                                    and
                                    footer, as well as more complex components that we decided to put in their own
                                    file, such as our design
                                    carousel.
                                    After, we began work on each of the individual pages, where I was responsible
                                    for the team and partnership
                                    pages.
                                    In the wireframe handed to us, we found these colored rectangle boxes that
                                    floated in seemingly random positions
                                    that
                                    added dimension and color. We had issue in trying to implement these as images,
                                    and so we used basic problem
                                    solving
                                    to figure out that we could use empty image containers as color blocks. The
                                    whole process was filled with
                                    problem
                                    solving
                                    and constant web research, since we were both somewhat new to Web Development,
                                    but we ended up quite happy with
                                    the
                                    end product for the Desktop screens.

                                <p>The Web Development team pushed back this portion of the project until the summer
                                    due to COVID-19 and the shock
                                    it
                                    left the team, since we were all college students at UC Berkeley who were
                                    suddenly returning to our respective
                                    homes.
                                    However, after the Spring 2020 semester had come to a close, we felt as a team
                                    that we were adjusted to this new
                                    work
                                    environment and were able to resume this project. With a smaller summer team,
                                    the new design and web development
                                    side
                                    team consisted of Emily, Peter, and me. As mentioned above, Emily and I
                                    collaborated to make the wireframes on
                                    Figma
                                    for the new mobile and tablet pages. Once approved, we as a team used notion to
                                    delegate tasks and keep us well
                                    organized/managed.
                                </p>

                                <p>Once tasks were delagated, we were off to work and once again utilized GitHub to
                                    collaborate, but also used
                                    Slack
                                    as a way to communicate effectively, as to minimize merge conflicts. I was first
                                    tasked with working on the
                                    mobile
                                    navigation bar, where it would be a tap-to-trigger "hamburger" menu that would
                                    trigger a column of screen
                                    options
                                    on
                                    the right side of the screen and redesigning the logo used to navigate to the
                                    home page (no text, just the "y"
                                    logo).
                                    My teammates worked on other components like the footer and the selectable
                                    scroll function. Once all shared
                                    components
                                    were fully implemented, we then began work on the actual screens. I was
                                    responsible for the home page and team
                                    page. For
                                    the most part, I kept the home page pretty faithful to the original desktop
                                    screen, but I made heavy
                                    altercations
                                    to
                                    the team page to better fit the mobile screen. At first glance, each member's
                                    profile image is viewable. Each
                                    image is
                                    then tappable to trigger an overlay box that displays each member's respective
                                    "bio" and profile. After we
                                    finished
                                    building the separate components and screens, we stitched all the pages together
                                    using media queries to select a
                                    screen based off of the user's screen pixel dimensions.

                                <p>Alongside Emily, I ideated, designed and implemented several banners throughout
                                    the the development of YHWH
                                    Apparel's website to promote the subscription to our webletter and for the
                                    "Assurance" product launch. For both of
                                    these banners, we wanted to maintain the branding identity of the company while
                                    also utilizing new imagery to pop
                                    and stand out. For the "Assurance" product release banner, we used imagery
                                    related to the product theme and the
                                    product images themselves to help market, and for the newsletter subscription
                                    banner, we used this opportunity to
                                    highlight old designs and highlight the work we have done in the past. You can
                                    see mockups of both banners in
                                    desktop and mobile views, as well as the "Assurance" QR product card below:

                    <p>I'm Robb Matthew Flores, but I go by Matt. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied
                        Cognitive Science
                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility to tech and have a
                        passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
