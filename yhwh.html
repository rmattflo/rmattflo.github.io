                                    <p>Originally being apart of the Web Development team, Peter and I were handed a
                                        completed desktop wireframe from
                                        Emily and were able to work directly from it. The most important things were to
                                        keep the color scheme and
                                        general
                                        feel the same, so we could move elements around slightly to make it easier on us
                                        as we worked on the code
                                        structure. While our main color was neutral browns, we were given a collection
                                        of possible accent colors, seen
                                        below.

                                    <p>When the time came to begin work on the responsive design for both mobile and
                                        tablet platforms, I was apart of
                                        a 4-person summer team. This meant I worked on both web development and design,
                                        so I was able to work in
                                        collaboration
                                        with Emily to create the wireframes for the mobile and tablet screens using both
                                        Adobe XD and Figma. The tablet
                                        screens
                                        for the most part were the same as the desktop screen but had a few adjustments
                                        to fit the sizing and touch
                                        screen.
                                        However, the mobile screens went through a more drastic change to fit the screen
                                        size adjustment. We had to
                                        simplify
                                        elements like our logo and navigation bar, team page, and designs page, among
                                        others, in order to better display
                                        all
                                        our information effectively on this platform.

                                    <p>Being one of two members in the Web Development Team, I collaborated with my
                                        superior and mentor, Peter, to
                                        learn more about the web development process. I began shadowing and observing
                                        him as he worked on the home page,
                                        and then began working on my own respective pages once I gained confidence. We
                                        began by working on the same
                                        laptop,
                                        but as I gained more independence throughout the project, we moved to separate
                                        computers and used GitHub as our
                                        main method of collaboration. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, relying
                                        heavily on the React library.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We worked first on shared components that would be shared on every screen, such
                                        as the navigation bar, logo,
                                        and
                                        footer, as well as more complex components that we decided to put in their own
                                        file, such as our design
                                        carousel.
                                        After, we began work on each of the individual pages, where I was responsible
                                        for the team and partnership
                                        pages.
                                        In the wireframe handed to us, we found these colored rectangle boxes that
                                        floated in seemingly random positions
                                        that
                                        added dimension and color. We had issue in trying to implement these as images,
                                        and so we used basic problem
                                        solving
                                        to figure out that we could use empty image containers as color blocks. The
                                        whole process was filled with
                                        problem
                                        solving
                                        and constant web research, since we were both somewhat new to Web Development,
                                        but we ended up quite happy with
                                        the
                                        end product for the Desktop screens.

                                    <p>The Web Development team pushed back this portion of the project until the summer
                                        due to COVID-19 and the shock
                                        it
                                        left the team, since we were all college students at UC Berkeley who were
                                        suddenly returning to our respective
                                        homes.
                                        However, after the Spring 2020 semester had come to a close, we felt as a team
                                        that we were adjusted to this new
                                        work
                                        environment and were able to resume this project. With a smaller summer team,
                                        the new design and web development
                                        side
                                        team consisted of Emily, Peter, and me. As mentioned above, Emily and I
                                        collaborated to make the wireframes on
                                        Figma
                                        for the new mobile and tablet pages. Once approved, we as a team used notion to
                                        delegate tasks and keep us well
                                        organized/managed.

                                    <p>Once tasks were delagated, we were off to work and once again utilized GitHub to
                                        collaborate, but also used
                                        Slack
                                        as a way to communicate effectively, as to minimize merge conflicts. I was first
                                        tasked with working on the
                                        mobile
                                        navigation bar, where it would be a tap-to-trigger "hamburger" menu that would
                                        trigger a column of screen
                                        options
                                        on
                                        the right side of the screen and redesigning the logo used to navigate to the
                                        home page (no text, just the "y"
                                        logo).
                                        My teammates worked on other components like the footer and the selectable
                                        scroll function. Once all shared
                                        components
                                        were fully implemented, we then began work on the actual screens. I was
                                        responsible for the home page and team
                                        page. For
                                        the most part, I kept the home page pretty faithful to the original desktop
                                        screen, but I made heavy
                                        altercations
                                        to
                                        the team page to better fit the mobile screen. At first glance, each member's
                                        profile image is viewable. Each
                                        image is
                                        then tappable to trigger an overlay box that displays each member's respective
                                        "bio" and profile. After we
                                        finished
                                        building the separate components and screens, we stitched all the pages together
                                        using media queries to select a
                                        screen based off of the user's screen pixel dimensions.

                                    <p>Alongside Emily, I ideated, designed and implemented several banners throughout
                                        the the development of YHWH
                                        Apparel's website to promote the subscription to our webletter and for the
                                        "Assurance" product launch. For both of
                                        these banners, we wanted to maintain the branding identity of the company while
                                        also utilizing new imagery to pop
                                        and stand out. For the "Assurance" product release banner, we used imagery
                                        related to the product theme and the
                                        product images themselves to help market, and for the newsletter subscription
                                        banner, we used this opportunity to
                                        highlight old designs and highlight the work we have done in the past. You can
                                        see mockups of both banners in
                                        desktop and mobile views, as well as the "Assurance" QR product card below:
