                                <p>After deciding on making a zine, I initially thought, "what story could I tell?"
                                    Reflecting on my past
                                    works, for the most
                                    part, they were either practice pieces (for fun, experimentation, etc.) or
                                    designs for work (like school
                                    organizations,
                                    companies, design challenges, etc.). So, pretty early on, I knew I wanted to
                                    make something more for me
                                    - something that
                                    I could be proud of and present to my friends. I ended up deciding to make a
                                    zine centralizing on how I
                                    would introduce
                                    myself, since I’m a bit awkward and my words don’t really present myself
                                    accurately. This way, I could
                                    dedicate spreads
                                    to my different hobbies, passions, and parts of my identity - my name, my
                                    ethnicity, my languages, my
                                    favorite forms of
                                    media, favorite foods, etc.

                            <div class="inner">

                                    <h2>Layout</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>In terms of design, I had 2 main ideas, since I knew that my content would be
                                    pretty all over the place.
                                    My first
                                    concept was to tie the whole zine together with an overarching puzzle theme, or
                                    segment each spread by a
                                    different color
                                    of the rainbow. I ended up using the rainbow concept because it could reflect
                                    the different aspects of
                                    myself using the
                                    different colors. In terms of content, I also wanted to incorporate my fashion
                                    sense, since I love
                                    clothes, into my
                                    zine, so each spread has a vector graphic of me in a different outfit. Because
                                    of this, I dedicated one
                                    page of each
                                    spread to be more illustration based and another to be more text based. Here I
                                    played around with
                                    different concepts,
                                    using text as illustrations/art to take up negative space, such as my mirror
                                    concept, puzzle concept (I
                                    still got to use
                                    the concept that I thought I would scrap!), magazine cover concept, and phone
                                    concept. I wanted this to
                                    be my playground
                                    to show multiple facets of myself. What I failed to think of until the end
                                    however, were the front and
                                    back covers! So,
                                    conceptually I thought, in an introduction, you don’t know people at all (pretty
                                    much a void) at first,
                                    but by the end,
                                    you should get a good grasp of who they are. So I thought of using a polaroid
                                    that’s developing at
                                    first, and the same
                                    polaroid fully developed at the end. And in terms of the cover’s background
                                    color, I decided to go with
                                    pure white
                                    because that's the result when you put all colors of the rainbow together.

                                <p>In order to create the final illustrations, I used procreate in order to quickly

                                    personal vector graphics with precision. I utilized Adobe Illustration to create
                                    each page, and decided
                                    on using variations of Futura as my body text, and using Meno Banner for my
                                    accent text.

                                <p>As for the final mock ups, I decided to go for a minimalistic approach and
                                    showcase each spread and both covers in individual shots, to showcase what I
                                    would like them to look like if they were to be printed and distributed. I
                                    mainly used photoshop to create these simple mockups.</p>

                    <h2>Mini Bio</h2>
                    <p>I'm Robb Matthew Flores, but I go by Matt. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied
                        Cognitive Science
                        and Design Innovation.<br />Career-wise,
                        I hope to
                        continue working in the product design field to increase accessibility to tech and have a
                        passion for
                        all things
                        user-centered.<br />Other than that, I love open-style dance & choreography, cafe hopping, food
                        culture
                        and playing video games. Feel free to ask me for recomendations for food/boba, my
                        favorite
                        open-style
                        choreographers
                        and dance teams, my opinions on the direction Pokemon is going towards, or any of my
                        past
                        projects.</p>
