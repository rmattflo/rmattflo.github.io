                    <p><b>Task</b>: A personal project I took on during the end of the fall 2020 semester of my junior
                        year
                        in college. My goal was to create a personal zine that follows the flow of how I would ideally
                        introduce myself to a stranger. I used this project to stretch my design brain and to experiment
                        with different types of layouts and concepts I haven't done before.</p>

                                    </header>
                                    <p>After deciding on making a zine, I initially thought, "what story could I tell?"
                                        Reflecting on my past
                                        works, for the most
                                        part, they were either practice pieces (for fun, experimentation, etc.) or
                                        designs for work (like school
                                        organizations,
                                        companies, design challenges, etc.). So, pretty early on, I knew I wanted to
                                        make something more for me
                                        - something that
                                        I could be proud of and present to my friends. I ended up deciding to make a
                                        zine centralizing on how I
                                        would introduce
                                        myself, since I’m a bit awkward and my words don’t really present myself
                                        accurately. This way, I could
                                        dedicate spreads
                                        to my different hobbies, passions, and parts of my identity - my name, my
                                        ethnicity, my languages, my
                                        favorite forms of
                                        media, favorite foods, etc.

                                        <h2>Layout</h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>In terms of design, I had 2 main ideas, since I knew that my content would be
                                        pretty all over the place.
                                        My first
                                        concept was to tie the whole zine together with an overarching puzzle theme, or
                                        segment each spread by a
                                        different color
                                        of the rainbow. I ended up using the rainbow concept because it could reflect
                                        the different aspects of
                                        myself using the
                                        different colors. In terms of content, I also wanted to incorporate my fashion
                                        sense, since I love
                                        clothes, into my
                                        zine, so each spread has a vector graphic of me in a different outfit. Because
                                        of this, I dedicated one
                                        page of each
                                        spread to be more illustration based and another to be more text based. Here I
                                        played around with
                                        different concepts,
                                        using text as illustrations/art to take up negative space, such as my mirror
                                        concept, puzzle concept (I
                                        still got to use
                                        the concept that I thought I would scrap!), magazine cover concept, and phone
                                        concept. I wanted this to
                                        be my playground
                                        to show multiple facets of myself. What I failed to think of until the end
                                        however, were the front and
                                        back covers! So,
                                        conceptually I thought, in an introduction, you don’t know people at all (pretty
                                        much a void) at first,
                                        but by the end,
                                        you should get a good grasp of who they are. So I thought of using a polaroid
                                        that’s developing at
                                        first, and the same
                                        polaroid fully developed at the end. And in terms of the cover’s background
                                        color, I decided to go with
                                        pure white
                                        because that's the result when you put all colors of the rainbow together.

                                    <p>In order to create the final illustrations, I used procreate in order to quickly

                                        personal vector graphics with precision. I utilized Adobe Illustration to create
                                        each page, and decided
                                        on using variations of Futura as my body text, and using Meno Banner for my
                                        accent text.

                                    <p>As for the final mock ups, I decided to go for a minimalistic approach and
                                        showcase each spread and both covers in individual shots, to showcase what I
                                        would like them to look like if they were to be printed and distributed. I
                                        mainly used photoshop to create these simple mockups.</p>
