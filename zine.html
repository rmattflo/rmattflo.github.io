                <p><b>Task:</b> A personal project I took on during the end of the fall 2020 semester of my junior year
                    in college. My goal was to create a personal zine that follows the flow of how I would ideally
                    introduce myself to a stranger. I used this project to stretch my design brain and to experiment
                    with different types of layouts and concepts I haven't done before.
                </p>

        <div class="zine-process">
            <p><b>Ideation</b></p>
            <p>After deciding on making a zine, I initially thought, "what story could I tell?" Reflecting on my past
                works, for the most
                part, they were either practice pieces (for fun, experimentation, etc.) or designs for work (like school
                organizations,
                companies, design challenges, etc.). So, pretty early on, I knew I wanted to make something more for me
                - something that
                I could be proud of and present to my friends. I ended up deciding to make a zine centralizing on how I
                would introduce
                myself, since I’m a bit awkward and my words don’t really present myself accurately. This way, I could
                dedicate spreads
                to my different hobbies, passions, and parts of my identity - my name, my ethnicity, my languages, my
                favorite forms of
                media, favorite foods, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Layout</b></p>
            <p>In terms of design, I had 2 main ideas, since I knew that my content would be pretty all over the place.
                My first
                concept was to tie the whole zine together with an overarching puzzle theme, or segment each spread by a
                different color
                of the rainbow. I ended up using the rainbow concept because it could reflect the different aspects of
                myself using the
                different colors. In terms of content, I also wanted to incorporate my fashion sense, since I love
                clothes, into my
                zine, so each spread has a vector graphic of me in a different outfit. Because of this, I dedicated one
                page of each
                spread to be more illustration based and another to be more text based. Here I played around with
                different concepts,
                using text as illustrations/art to take up negative space, such as my mirror concept, puzzle concept (I
                still got to use
                the concept that I thought I would scrap!), magazine cover concept, and phone concept. I wanted this to
                be my playground
                to show multiple facets of myself. What I failed to think of until the end however, were the front and
                back covers! So,
                conceptually I thought, in an introduction, you don’t know people at all (pretty much a void) at first,
                but by the end,
                you should get a good grasp of who they are. So I thought of using a polaroid that’s developing at
                first, and the same
                polaroid fully developed at the end. And in terms of the cover’s background color, I decided to go with
                pure white
                because that's the result when you put all colors of the rainbow together.</p>

            <p><b>Illustration</b></p>
            <p>In order to create the final illustrations, I used procreate in order to quickly and easily create my
                personal vector graphics with precision. I utilized Adobe Illustration to create each page, and decided
                on using variations of Futura as my body text, and using Meno Banner for my accent text.</p>
            <p>Going in order, each spread represents a different aspect of what I would share during my ideal
                introduction.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First glimpse, my full name, and what I prefer to be called</li>
                <li>Some basic information about me and what languages I speak</li>
                <li>Where I was born and where I was raised - and a little inside joke to my friends (since they joke
                    around and say that
                    I’m Pacific Islander, not Asian)</li>
                <li>My career and major + my convoluted path to get there, and what I use to cope with struggles</li>
                <li>A list of my favorite things</li>
                <li>Dance (cuz it's super important to me) and a final lesson that I’ve been learning this year</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As mentioned above, for the front and back covers, I played with a polaroid photo concept, with the front
                cover showcasing a developing picture, which is again displayed as the back cover, but fully developed,
                to signify how an introduction helps us to buil our perception of people.</p>

            <p><b>Mockups</b></p>
            <p>As for the final mock ups, I decided to go for a minimalistic approach and showcase each spread and both
                covers in individual shots, to showcase what I would like them to look like if they were to be printed
                and distributed. I mainly used photoshop to create these simple mockups.</p>
